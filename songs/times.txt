The Times They Are A-Changing

Come gather ′round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changing

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won′t come again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel′s still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
For the loser now will be later to win
'Cause the times, they are a-changing

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don′t stand in the doorway, don′t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
'Cause the battle outside raging
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changing

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don′t criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can′t lend your hand
'Cause the times, they are a-changing

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
The slowest now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
′Cause the times, they are a-changing
