Knocking on Heaven's Door Songtext

Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feel I'm knocking on Heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I'm knocking on Heaven's door

Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
